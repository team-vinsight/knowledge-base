[UAV-assisted Visual SLAM Generating Reconstructed 3D Scene Graphs in GPS-denied Environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG3Bw1giBxo)

This work aims to showcase map reconstruction of indoor environments and generate 3D [#scene_graphs](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/scene_graphs) for a high-level representation using a camera mounted on a [#drone](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/drone). Accordingly, an aerial [#robot](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/robot) equipped with a companion computer and an RGB-D camera was employed to be integrated with a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ([#VSLAM](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/vslam)) framework proposed by the authors. To enhance [#situational_awareness](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/situational_awareness) while reconstructing maps, various structural elements, i.e., doors and walls, were labeled with printed fiducial markers, and a dictionary of their topological relations was fed to the system.  🔗 Links:
